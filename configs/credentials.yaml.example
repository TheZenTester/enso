# ENSO Credentials Configuration
#
# SETUP: Copy this file to credentials.yaml and fill in your values:
#   cp credentials.yaml.example credentials.yaml
#
# Password resolution options (in priority order):
#   1. Direct password: password: "MyP@ssword!"  
#      - Recommended for convenience during an engagement
#      - Consider: chmod 600 credentials.yaml
#      - Do NOT commit to version control if password is set!
#   2. Environment variable: password: "${ENV_VAR_NAME}"
#      - Works anytime, safe to commit
#   3. Omit password field: Will prompt at runtime
#
# Use enabled: false to skip a credential during sync

# Nessus web-UI credentials (session auth fallback)
#
# Nessus Professional 10.x disables scan creation via API keys.
# When this is detected, ENSO falls back to session auth using
# these web-UI credentials.  If omitted, you'll be prompted at
# runtime.
